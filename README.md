# Angular-Project
In this repository its my first angular project "Cab book".
The car booking app built in Angular is a web application that allows users to 
search, book, and manage car rentals online. The application built using Angular 
utilizes components, services, and modules which play a vital role in this project. 
It takes JSON data to store the register user and for user convenience login 
purpose and validation.
